# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection with Grad-CAM 🔬

A real-time AI-powered web application to detect plant diseases from leaf images. Built using **PyTorch**, **Streamlit**, and deployed via **Streamlit Cloud**. Also includes **Grad-CAM** visualization for model explainability.

[🌐 Live App Demo](https://plant-disease-detection-hvxzmj8lebsnzvp7crta23.streamlit.app/)

## 📌 Features

- 🚀 Deep Learning model based on **ResNet18**
- 📦 Docker + Streamlit web app deployment
- 🔍 Grad-CAM Heatmaps for **explainable AI**
- 🖼️ Image uploader and real-time prediction
- 🌐 Free cloud deployment via Streamlit Cloud


## 🧪 Model Details

- Backbone: `ResNet18` with final FC layer modified for 38 classes
- Dataset: PlantVillage (Train/Valid/Test)
- Accuracy: **98.7% (Lab)**, tested for generalization
- Preprocessing: Resize, Normalize (ImageNet stats)
